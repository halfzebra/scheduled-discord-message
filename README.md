# scheduled-discord-message

This project serves as a starting poing for an app, which can send Discord messages to a Webhook endppoint.

## Motivation

> Why this is written in Rust?

This application is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi, where I want to use the CPU as efficiently as possible.
The hypothesis is that Rust allows that, but the benchmark is to be implemented.
